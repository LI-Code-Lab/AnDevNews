# AnDev News

AnDev News started as a personal project to make reading Android Weekley news letters easier. I wanted the ability to read articles in an app and bookmark the ones I found most interesting. I have bene using the app for a few years and have decided I would like to add more to it. Possibly add other news sources, etc. 

I have decided to open source this project with the belief that other developers could have a lot to contribute. Finding time to work on this has become difficult for me but I feel together we can create a centralized source of news for Android that the entire community could benefit from. 

## Goals
