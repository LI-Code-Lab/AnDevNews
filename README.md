# AnDev News

AnDev News started as a personal project to make reading Android Weekly newsletters easier. I wanted the ability to read articles in a native app while bookmarking the ones I found most interesting. I have been using the app for several years and have decided it could become something more by adding new features/news sources and improving existing ones.

Open sourcing seemed like a no brainer. Let us create a centralized source of news for Android that the entire community could benefit from. 

## Goals

* Implement best practices for the platform
* Represent broad content in an enjoyable native experience
* Have fun and build something beneficial for everyone

## Ideas For Improvement

* Support for AndroidCommunity.com news
* Ability to stream Fragmented podcast. 
* Feel free to add your ideas
